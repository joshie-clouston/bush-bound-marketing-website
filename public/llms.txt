> Custom vehicle fit-outs for 4WDs, vans and work vehicles. Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.

## What We Do

Bushbound designs and builds custom vehicle fit-outs using premium laminated plywood. We handle cabinetry, water systems and power systems (12V, 24V, 48V) — everything you need to be self-sufficient on the road.

## Our Process

1. Consultation — we learn about your vehicle and how you use it
2. 3D Design — you see your fit-out rendered in full 3D before we start
3. Build — precision-built from laminated plywood in our Gold Coast workshop
4. Install — we install everything and get you road-ready
