> Custom 4WD and van fit-outs for expedition and touring — Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.

## What We Do

Bushbound designs and builds custom vehicle fit-outs for 4WDs and vans using premium laminated plywood. We handle cabinetry, water systems and power systems (12V, 24V, 48V) — everything you need to be self-sufficient on the road. Every build starts with a full 3D design so you see the fit-out before we start.

## Who It's For

- Touring and camping enthusiasts setting up 4WDs and Troopys for extended off-road travel
- Van lifers converting Sprinters, HiAces and Transits into homes on wheels
- Anyone planning a lap of Australia, weekend escapes or long-term off-grid adventures

## Our Process

1. Free consultation — we learn about your vehicle and how you travel
2. 3D design preview — you see your fit-out rendered in full 3D before we build
3. Precision build — built from premium laminated plywood in our Gold Coast workshop
4. Professional install — we install everything and get you road-ready
